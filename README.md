# Havel Hamiki Demonstration

This application was made for the Summer of Math Exposition #1. It aims to teach a bit about Graph Theory, and how to visually understand a particular theorem.

## To use

The source code is included for anyone who wants it, but all you need to run the app is to download the 'Excecutables' folder, and run the .exe file. It should definitely work on Windows, but hopefully it works on other platforms, too (I'm not an expert on this kind of stuff)

## Credits and Thanks

This is made in Visual Studio C++, using the PixelGameEngine as a base, which can be found here: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine

Thanks to my teachers for introducing to this stuff.
