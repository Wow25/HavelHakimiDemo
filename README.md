# Havel Hakimi Demonstration

This application was made for the Summer of Math Exposition #1. It aims to teach a bit about Graph Theory, and how to visually understand a particular theorem.

## How to use

I'm still new to exporting code and stuff, so if it doesn't work, that's probably my fault. You *should* be able to just download the 'Release' folder and run the GraphTheory.exe file inside, but your antivirus might not like it very much (I also have no idea if this works on anything but Windows). Otherwise, you *should* be able to download the whole thing, build it yourself in Visual Studio or something similar, and run it from there.

Like I said, if you can't get it to work, that's on me.

## Credits and Thanks

This was made in Visual Studio 2019 C++, using the PixelGameEngine as a base, which can be found here: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine

Thanks to my teachers for introducing me to this stuff.
